Solving Algorithm Problem

My daily solving algorithms with **Golang**
## Problem 1: Check if two arrays are equal or not 
Given two given integer arrays of any length without sorting them, the task is to find if the given arrays are equal or not. Two arrays are said to be equal if both of them contain the same set of elements. O(n^2)
## Problem 2: MergeSort in Golang
Simple RECURSIVE MergeSort [MergeSort wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) Θ(nlg(n)) by Master's theorem case 2
## Problem 3: BinarySearch in Golang
Simple RECURSIVE BinarySearch without loop [BinarySearch wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) Θ(lg(n)) by Master's theorem case 2
