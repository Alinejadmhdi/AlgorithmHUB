Solving Algorithm Problem in Algorithm Hub

My daily solving algorithms with **Golang**
## Problem 1: Check if two arrays are equal or not 
Given two given integer arrays of any length without sorting them, the task is to find if the given arrays are equal or not. Two arrays are said to be equal if both of them contain the same set of elements. O(n^2)
## Problem 2: MergeSort in Golang
Simple RECURSIVE MergeSort [MergeSort wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort). Growth Order: **Θ(nlg(n))** by **Master's theorem** case 2
## Problem 3: BinarySearch in Golang
Simple RECURSIVE BinarySearch without loop [BinarySearch wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm). Growth Order: **Θ(lg(n))** by **Master's theorem** case 2
## Problem 4: Exponentiation in Golang
Simple RECURSIVE Power for integers [Exponentiation wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation). Growth Order: **Θ(lg(n))** by **Master's theorem** case 2
## Problem 5: Fibonacci in Golang
Simple RECURSIVE Fibonacci [Fibonacci wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). Growth Order: **Θ(n)** by **Master's theorem** case 1 (This theta is for calling the Fibonacci function **once** which I explained in the code, but the growth order for the Naive Recursive Algorithm is **Ω(φ^n)**(big Omega of Phi(Golden Ratio) powered by n))
